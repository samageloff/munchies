**Hi team (Rafal, Conrad):**

Please find my code assessment below. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Or build:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
